# Predicting Google Stock Prices Using LSTM and Keras
In this project, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units was used to predict the opening price of Google stock for January 2017. The model was trained on the historical stock data from the past five years to identify patterns and trends that could inform accurate predictions.

About RNN and LSTM
Traditional RNNs are limited by their short-term memory, which makes them less effective at learning long-term dependencies in sequential data. The development of LSTM networks addressed this limitation by incorporating memory cells that can retain information over extended sequences, making them far more powerful and popular for time series prediction tasks such as stock price forecasting.

Project Outcome
Using the LSTM model built with the Keras framework, the project successfully predicted Google’s stock price trends, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning approaches for financial data analysis.
